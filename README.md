# Grocery_Super_Market_Dataset-
A fictitious dataset was produced to help data analysts practice exploratory data analysis and visualization. The dataset contains information on consumer orders placed through a supermarket delivery app. 
Big thanks to Mohamed Harris for generating this useful data set for my students to practice.
